The agent metadata is used to describe the agent and its capabilities. It is typically a
short description of the agent, its authors, and its tags. The metadata is typically written in
YAML, and is included at the top of the agent definition. `id`, `version`, `name`, and `description` are top level
fields, while `metadata` is optional and can contain any dictionary
of items. Two metadata fields that are included in the current implementation
are `authors` and `tags`. This does not preclude the addition of other metadata fields that can be
handled by the provider.

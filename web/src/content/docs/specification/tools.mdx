The tools section is used to describe the tools used by the agent, including their name, type,
and options. The tools section is typically written in YAML, and is included at the top of
the agent definition. Let's look at this section in more detail.

```yaml
tools:
  - name: coder
    type: Microsoft.CodeInterpreter
    options:
      connection: "https://contoso.crm.dynamics.com"
      other: "other"
```

The tools section is broken down into three sections:
- `name`: The name of the tool. This is typically a short string, but can be any string that is
  compatible with the agent.
- `type`: The type of the tool. This is typically a short string, but can be any string that is
  compatible with the tool type.
- `description`: An optional short description of the tool for metadata purposes. This is typically a short string,
  but can be any string that is compatible with the tool type.
- `options`: The options of the tool. This is typically a set of parameters that are
  compatible with the tool type.

If a tool type is a local function, the following allowance will be made in the interests of clarity
and brevity:

```yaml
tools:
  - name: menu-reader
    type: function
    patameters:
      menu:
        type: string
        description: The menu to display
      drinks:
        type: array
        description: The drinks to display
```


Since this section is in the frontmatter, it is not dynamic and cannot be used by the template engine
to configure dynamically. This is a static options of the tools used by the agent.
